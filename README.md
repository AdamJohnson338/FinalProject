This project is for interpreting the output of audio files at different frequencies and plotting the output as a sine wave. The program is used for being a spectrogram by using a range of differing audio properties to generate parameters for waves. This exists in order to have students work in a group and create a comprehensive interactive data analysis and modeling platform to plot sine waves of sound waves in enclosed spaces. To use this program, make sure to pip install the packages needed to run the program in the requirements.txt. After installing the packages, click the green run button on the top right of the screen. A graphical user interface will appear showing a button in the middle to open a file. Find a file that involves audio and open the file. The program should then show you 6 plots with an additional low, mid, and high plot.
